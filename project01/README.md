Project 01: Hypergraph

Description:

A Hypergraph is a data structure. Its definition is a graph whose hyperedges connect two or more vertices. it is generalized as an undirected graph. For example the verticies of the hypergraph could be individual countries and the hyperedges could represent one aspect of the country's flag. It requires n x m space, n represents the number of verticies and m is the number of hyperedges. Each row in the matrix would represent a vertex and each column would represent an edge. One basic structure for a hypergraph is an incidence matrix.
