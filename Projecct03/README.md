#Project 03: Levenshtein Distance

###Description:

The Levenshtein distance algorithm is finding the least amount of changes to transform one string into another string. One step counts as either an insertion, deletion. A substitution counts a two steps because it must perform a deletion and an insertion.

###To use this code:
* First make sure that your HTML file has two input fields. 

* Then all that is required is that you include this <script src="levenstien.js"></script> and jQuery into your HTML file.

* An example of this in in the HTML file.
