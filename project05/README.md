#Project 05: Data Vis

###Description:
Used Graphviz to demonstrate how one graph can be displayed in various different ways.

"Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics,  software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains."(Grpahviz webpage)

Graphviz has a few layouts for the user to choose from:
*dot - Hierarchical
*neato - spring model
*fdp - spring model - similar to neato 
*sfdp - fdp for large graphs
*twopi - radial 
*circo - circular 

###To use Graphviz:
* First download Graphviz from their website
* save data as a .dot
* open up command line
* use Graphviz commands ex: dot -Tsvg digraph.dot > digraph.svg


### Contents:
project05 contains the following files
* digraph.dot - data file - data found on Graphviz
* 5 SVG files - different graph representation of data
* graph.svg.graffle - SVG of data but used omnigraffle for further formatting
